Hi, my name is Yannik Potdevin and I am currently a PhD student of the
dependable systems group (Prof. Dirk Nowotka) at Kiel University.
My research interest covers reliable autonomous systems, especially robust
machine learning.

In this blog I share interesting research I faced during my work.
